Repository Information:
	▪	This repository is part of my learning process where I’m going over everything from scratch.
	▪	Somethings are new to me, somethings I already knew, and most of it was the in-depth information about the concepts I’m already familiar with.
	▪	Nonetheless, I took notes for my-own reference here so that I can come back and go over the doc-strings in each file and review the concept.
	▪	I tried to keep the doc-strings and comments as descriptive as possible (with examples in some places) so that if anyone with minimum exposer can even come and read through the codes and understand the concept.
	▪	The code snippets in each file are completely executable so that the doc-strings info is more followable with a working example. (1-2 might not be, because this repository is still in progress, and will always be. I’ll be adding everything I’m learning here. And I’m, by no mean done learning, and not planning on stopping anytime soon.)
	▪	The variable names are not as descriptive as I usually keep. When I started this, I wasn’t planning on starting a git repo, but the idea developed this way. But the Print statements are very descriptive. You’ll know exactly what it is.
	▪	Please, if anyone has any inputs for me to improve this repository, I’m all ears. And, if you find this helpful and know anyone who might get benefited from this, please by all means share it.
